    <h2>My Favorite Sport</h2>

    <b><p>My favorite sport is <u><i>soccer</u></i>. My main position is Keeper. If you don't know what a keeper is, here is what they look like and how to become one.<p>

      <br><br>

      <p>One thing that I really don't understand in America is that they think soccer isn't a manly sport. They think that it is just people running around and then pretending to get hurt. But they do love football, which is just people smacking into eachother and throwing a ball. They don't even run for longer then 5 seconds.</p>
